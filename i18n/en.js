/* English UI text - the only file in the project with user-facing wording.
 *
 * Shipped as JS rather than .json for the same reason data/mapdata.js is:
 * index.html has to work when it is opened straight off the disk, and no
 * browser will fetch a file:// URL. Everything after the assignment is
 * plain JSON, so it lifts straight into en.json if this ever gets served
 * over HTTP. To add a language, copy this file and swap the script tag.
 *
 * {token} is filled in at run time. Continent and country names are not
 * here: they come from the map data, built by build/build_map.py.
